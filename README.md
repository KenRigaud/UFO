UFO sightings challenge 11

### Analysis
This analysis main focus was being able to aggregate UFO sighting data into a filterable form using bootstrap, html, and java. Given an initial javascript (js) file, our job was to master javascript fundamentals to open the file and put it into a readable form that not only myself, but others who are interested can observe the data.

### Results:
Many of the UFO findings seem to be in the United States, so this filter works wonders to help weed out the most common location and take note of places in Europe, Mexico, and the like. Though there are many shapes of UFO's out there, circular or spherical tend to be the most common.

### How to do it yourself
Understanding the basic principles of Javascript and prerequisite knowledge in Python goes a long way in this module. We essentially use functions to organize the objects in the .js file into a consistent format that html can handle. After that, it's about properly using the containers and formatting options available to allow for automation as the data file is very large. At the end, we use Boostrap to customize the website and make it appealing to all those who like space and easy to access data.

### Summary:
Though the filter tool is fairly simple and straightforward, its biggest short coming lie in the fact that the user doesn't know what to filter the data on. It require preknowledge of all possible filters and or trial and error which is incredibly inefficient. This issue could be fix in future project, by learning how to build a selectable drop down menu in html. This way it's easy to filter and see all posibilities very quickly. I'd also suggect more image url's to help guide the user on what the shapes mean since it is a fairly important endeavor. The user may want to compare their finding with others and though the shapes are descriptive, an image would do significantly better.
